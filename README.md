# CO2-emission-prediction-in-cars-regression

## Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine learning, supervised learning, regression

## Project Introduction:

   This project is based on a kaggle dataset. Objective of the project is to predict the amount of carbon dioxide emitting from different cars using supervised learning techniques (specifically regression is used here). Regression is a widely used learning algorithm which helps in predicting continuous numerical outputs.

## Machine learning algos used:

### linear regression:

  The most basic regression algorithm which make predictions by simply computing weighted sum of input features adding a bias term.

### Lasso Regression:
  
  Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression(Lasso) is a regularized version of linear regression which adds a regularization term to the cost function using l1 norm or Manhattan norm.
### Ridge Regression:
    
   Similar to lasso regression but uses l2 norm or Eucledian norm of the weight vector.

### Decision Tree :
   
   A versatile learning algorithm that can perform regression, classification, multi-ouputs tasks even on complex data sets using tree structure(root and leaf nodes).
    
### Random Forest:
  
  Random forest is an ensemble of decision trees which introduces extra randomness(that is it searches for best feature among a random subset of fatures) when growing trees instead of searching for very best feature when splitting a node.
   
### Simple Vector Machine:
  
  SVM is also a versatile learning algo able to perform linear and non-linear classification, regression and even outlier detection. Here Linear SVM is used.
   
## Metrics used for model evaluation:
  ### 1. RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error):
          
   RMSE is the standard deviation of the prediction errors called residuals. Residuals point to the randomness of data points from the regression line. RMSE tells us how concentrated the data is around the regression line.
  
  ### 2. MAE(Mean Absolute Error):
        
   MAE measures the absolute distance between the real data and predicted data.
   
   ### 3. R2 score:
         
   R-Square is another statistical measure which indicates how well the regression predictions approximate the real data points.
